# Bio
learning Python Advanced and building small projects to practice file handling, exceptions, and error management.

# Project Files
- `visitor_log.py` → The main Python program for managing visitor entries.  
- `visitors.txt` → Stores visitor names and timestamps. Automatically created if missing.  

# How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
3. Navigate to this folder, for example:  
   ```bash
   cd  "C:\Users\ALADE James\OneDrive\Desktop\Assignments
   
4. Run the program:
  bash
  python visitor_log.py

5. Enter visitor names when prompted.

The program will enforce these rules:

No back-to-back sign-ins by the same visitor.

At least 5 minutes must pass before the next visitor can sign in.
